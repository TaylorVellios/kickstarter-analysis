# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview
A look into the viability of the fundraising platform Kickstarter for live theater projects in the US.

### Purpose
By looking at past Kickstarters, I will be looking for data trends that can assist with determining the ideal conditions for achieving a successful fundraising effort.

## Analysis and Challenges
Kickstarter is a vast platform that allows almost anyone to begin a fundraising effort.
Thankfully, every fundraiser pulled from the platform is tied with heaps of useful data that can be filtered and categorized to hone in our target information.

Since there are two main goals to achieve, the data needed to be organized and filtered. From what was pulled from the Kickstarter platform, the first step was to separate the subcategories from their parent category. By using delimited Text to Columns, I was able to create a column that would easily narrow down "Plays" from the "Theater" category.
